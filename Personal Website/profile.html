        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website. I am an aspiring software engineer passionate about software creation, whether it is for fun, to solve real-life problems, to teach or learn and in the form of mobile applications, web applications, websites, AIs and bots I am ready to join! I am an extroverted introvert ready to sponge up new knowledge and skills and apply them. </p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Foundation</h3>
            <p>It all started in the humble grounds of Kgatlamping Primary School, I then went to Jiyana Secondary School were my technical spark was ignited by Computer Applications Technology(CAT) where I got introduced to Microsoft Office and HTML and was simultaneosly attending Saturday classes at Dimension Data where I further got introduced to python through the Cisco Networking Academy.</p>

            <h3>University of Pretoria</h3>
            <p>Fresh out of varsity I went to persue a degree in Computer Science at the University of Pretoria which did not work out as I had hoped, it was a tough journey full of obstacles and I unfortunately was defeated.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Wethinkcode_</h3>
            <p>I later found a home at Wethinkcode_ where I am currently doing my second year of software engineering, I am enjoying learning programming, its ethics and working in teams. It has been quite the fruitful journey, not easy but inducive. I have so far become familiar with python and java and have dabbled in topics such as OOP and TDD.</p>
